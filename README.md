# OxyDialogTest
Illustrates a bad interaction with OxyPlot and MaterialDesign's DialogHost

The program consists of two PlotViews: one in the main window, and one in a Material Design dialog. The PlotView in the main window is behaving correctly, while the PlotView in the dialog window is showing nothing. I added the ability to swap the models between the views just to confirm that both models are configured correctly.
